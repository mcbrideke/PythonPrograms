# PythonPrograms
Simple, helpful python programs to complete various tasks. Most of these are modified versions of existing code from several online resources that I changed to complete a specific job. 

# Get Files
Given a url, this program gets the file names of each file in the directory and subdirectories of the path and prints them (by default).
Can be modified to rename files, move files, delete files etc.
